# WORLD POPULATION EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)
## Overview
This is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of global population growth from 1970 to 2022. The dataset includes yearly information on total world population, annual growth rates, yearly population increases and population density. The main objective of the EDA is to understand historical trends that will help will analyze how the world population has evolved over time and highlight patterns, shifts and factors that may have influenced growth rates and density changes.
## Tools
* Python for data analysis
* Jupyter Notebook for interactive coding and data analysis and visualization
* MySQL/Aiven for database management and storage
* DBeaver workbench for managing and interacting with the database and running SQL queries
* Pandas for data cleaning and manipulation
* Matplotlib for data visualization
* Seaborn for drawing informative and statistical graphs
* Tableau for creating an interactive dashboard

## Problem Statement
The main objective of the EDA is to understand historical trends that will help will analyze how the world population has evolved over time and highlight patterns, shifts and factors that may have influenced growth rates and density changes.
## Findings
From the EDA these are the findings
## The 5 top populous countries in 2022 are
* China with a population of 1.43 billion
* India with a population of 1.42 billion
* United States with a population of 338 million
* Indonesia with a population of 275 million
* Pakistan with a population of 236 million
From the analysis India has experienced the most significant population growth since 1970, with a 154% increase, while the United States saw a more modest 69% growth.
## Countries with highest population density 
* Macau: 23,172 people per km²
* Monaco: 18,234 people per km²
* Singapore: 8,416 people per km²
* Hong Kong: 6,783 people per km²
* Gibraltar: 5,441 people per km²
These locations have limited land area, which significantly boosts their population density.
## Continental population growth trends
* Africa has the highest average growth rate at approximately 1.02%, indicating rapid population increases.
* Asia follows closely with a 1.01% average growth rate, contributing heavily to global population growth.
* Europe has the lowest growth rate, at around 1.00%, indicating more stable or even declining populations in some areas.
## Summary
* Asia and Africa are the major contributors to global population growth, with African nations in particular expected to see continued rapid increases.
* Densely populated regions often face challenges related to resource allocation, infrastructure, and environmental impact due to limited land area.
* Policies for population management and resource optimization are crucial, especially in high-growth areas.
