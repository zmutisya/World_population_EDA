# WORLD POPULATION EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)
## Overview
This is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of global population growth from 1970 to 2022. The dataset includes yearly information on total world population, annual growth rates, yearly population increases and population density. The main objective of the EDA is to understand historical trends that will help will analyze how the world population has evolved over time and highlight patterns, shifts and factors that may have influenced growth rates and density changes.
## Tools
* Python for data analysis
* Jupyter Notebook for interactive coding and data analysis and visualization
* MySQL/Aiven for database management and storage
* DBeaver workbench for managing and interacting with the database and running SQL queries
* Pandas for data cleaning and manipulation
* Matplotlib for data visualization
* Seaborn for drawing informative and statistical graphs
* Tableau for creating an interactive dashboard
